## Summary
By completing these tasks, I gained experience in calculating key user and financial metrics, such as Total Revenue, CR to Paid, ARPPU, Average Age, Median Age, and variability of user ages. I also learned to forecast user engagement metrics like WAU and DAU/WAU, and to create visualizations to track these metrics. Additionally, developed skills in cohort analysis, data summarization, and applying advanced Google Sheets functions like ARRAYFORMULA, VLOOKUP, and FILTER.
